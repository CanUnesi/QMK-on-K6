# Installing QMK on Keyhcron K6 RGB on Win10 for Dummies
This guide will walk you through on installing QMK on a Keychron K6 RGB keyboard. Even though repos exist for other models and the white backlit version, this guide will only cover the K6 RGB model with a SN32F24x MCU. 

You can follow these steps for other supported RGB boards, the difference in the steps for the other models lie in the location of the boot pins and the folders associated with the corresponding models. Some models, such as K4, will have their boot pins right under the spacebar and will require only the removal of the keycap rather than a full disassembly. White backlit K6 has a different MCU and isn't covered by this guide yet.

**There is a small chance that you may brick your keyboard in the flashing process**, continue at your own risk. Use an appropriate cable, make sure you won’t lose power during flashing and follow the steps carefully.

This guide doesn’t cover bluetooth connectivity, following this guide will disable your keyboards bluetooth mode.

**If you're here for VIA, see [check your MCU](#1-check-your-mcu) first and then follow [step 8](#8-optional-using-via).**

&nbsp; 

## 1. Check Your MCU

### 1.1. Remove the side plates and the plate screws
You’ll probably need an electronics screwdriver kit at this step. Disconnect your keyboard and keep it in “Cable” mode. 

Refer to [the official instructions](https://www.keychron.com/pages/how-to-disassemble-the-k6) for disassembly.

>Note: You don’t need to remove all the keycaps, removing ESC, 1, 7, 8, Backspace, Light Key, CTRL, WIN , Space, Down Arrow, Right arrow keys will be enough to access the screws.
### 1.2. Separate the PCB from the case
You can turn the keyboard over a soft surface to let the pcb drop or hold it with your hand as it detaches from the case.
### 1.3. Check your MCU serial number
The MCU is the chip with the red spot, read the serial numbers and google it to check it’s model, **these steps are valid only if you have a SN32F24x MCU**.

![](https://github.com/CanUnesi/QMK-on-K6/raw/main/image0.jpg)

In our case, the serial number is **HFD2201KBA**.

If you have trouble finding the model of your MCU, you could skip to **step 4** and follow until **step 6.2** to see the model in Sonix Flasher.
